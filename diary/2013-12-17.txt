First diary

Current status:
  Implemented PCA and tested it with multiple images datavases

  Followed coursera Hinton course up to and including RBM. Stop course for implementation
  Read the Hinton guide on traning RBMS
  Followed multiple youtube vidoes that talk about deep learning
  Looked at multiple implementations for RBM found on github
  Enquired a bit about the posibily (or need) of using theano for speed (using CPU)
  Took notes on all the given in the coursera course
  Got an intuitive understanding of the matter

  Implemented a simple version of RBM
  Downloaded MNIST data and running RBM for a part of it to visualize the weights

Done today:

TODO:
Short term:
 implement the free energy function
 RBM class needs a write function for serialization (see pickle)
 Add momentum to the RBM class
 Figure out how to parallelize some of the work; multiprocessing does not work with this

 Longer term:
  After finishing playing around with RBM, finish the coursera entire course
  Implement deep learning for discriminative learning using backpropagation
  Look at Abbas paper on increasing capacity of Hopfield
  Think of how to do it for RBM
  Increase speed: IMPORTANT
