Done today:
  Fixed the issue with the training: it was actually caused due to the normalization
  of the input: it was all 0 due to the type of the input being int

  Vizualizing the weights properly and checking the reconstruction

  Clean up all the debugging

  Test reconstruction on testing data

  Added various options to RBM: mini-batch, momentum

TODO:
Short term:
 implement the free energy function: or just a way to track error
 RBM class needs a write function for serialization (see pickle)- does it?
 as of tomorrow start the rest of the coursera course

 WHAT HAPPENS if you combine traning algorithms together/
  and you do the first data and then the second data.
  also due to batch learnign it might be best to take the data as
  an argument to the train funcion?
  setting the data as an argument to the initializing function of the RBM
    is not ok because it removes from the online part


  weight decay?


Long term:
  monitor the overfitting
  implement deep learning with backprop for MNIST
  maths stuff
