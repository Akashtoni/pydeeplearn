Done today:
  Thought a bit about the reinforcement learning that zheng did and thought how to adapt some of that work to deep belief nets

  got some papers on deep belief nets and reinforcement learning

  implemented dropuots for visible units and for rbms

  came up with an algorithm for reinforcement learning with db
