Done today:
  Looking at past interim reports to ensure that I have a good clue of what needs to be done.
  Realised that I wrote a bit too much for it, I wrote a lot for the actual report.

  More testing on MNIst data. Code is slow but I am looking at ways to improve.
  Could use Cpython or ohter things to impove parts of code.
  Some changes messed with the results I got so far, so I am owrking on fixing that.

  Having some trouble with Pandoc bib as well.

TODO:
  read more papers on RBM and deep learning
  and read Zhen's paper
