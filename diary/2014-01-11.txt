Done today:
  implemented dropout properly and looked at it
  running PCA on MNIST data and seeing what is happening
  running mnist with more layers with dropout but for some reason more layers does not work and we get the same predicition no matter what

  worked on Pandoc for citation generation. Got something done but clicking on the citation still does not work which is very annoying

  read a bit of zhen's report
