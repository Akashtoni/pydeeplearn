TODO:
  fix the problem with introducting multiple layers
  wake sleep for generation
  fix the learning rate
  play around with the learning rate for RBMs and the momentum

  make all these possible parameters as arguments to the script and check if they work

  implement and perform cross validation

  implement dropouts for rbms

  actually urn the MNIST with pca and then train
  fix the mnist memory problem when you have too many things

  learning rate for dbn should be 0.1

  think of implementing early stopping for the net
