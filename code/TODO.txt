TODO:
  wake sleep for generation: this is important because I can then use
    more unlabelled data for the emotion recognition task
  fix the learning rate
  play around with the learning rate for RBMs and the momentum

  make all these possible parameters as arguments to the script and check if they work

  implement and perform cross validation

  implement dropouts for rbms

  actually urn the MNIST with pca and then train
  fix the mnist memory problem when you have too many things

  learning rate for dbn should be 0.1

  think of implementing early stopping for the net

  especially important: implement chanign on the learning rate by monitoring the error
    I think there is something like this in the guide
